# Bank Loan Analysis Project ðŸ“ŠðŸ’»

## Overview
Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Project! This project focuses on leveraging SQL and Data Analytics techniques to analyze loan data and extract valuable insights for optimizing lending strategies and enhancing decision-making processes within a banking context.

## Key Features
- **Database Creation**: Utilized SQL to create a robust database infrastructure from scratch.
- **KPI Tracking**: Calculated and monitored various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) essential for evaluating lending activities, including Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).
- **Advanced SQL Functionalities**: Leveraged advanced SQL functionalities such as SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT, CTEs, and data manipulation functions like DATEPART, DATENAME, and MONTH for data analysis.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Provided actionable insights into demand trends, liquidity assessment, cash flow dynamics, profitability analysis, and credit risk evaluation.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends derived from the loan analysis.

## Folder Structure
- **SQL_Scripts**: Contains SQL scripts used for database creation, data manipulation, and analysis.
- **PowerBI_Dashboard**: Includes the Power BI file (.pbix) for the interactive dashboard visualization.
- **Documentation**: Includes project documentation, including this README file.
  
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the SQL_Scripts folder.
3. Run the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to create the database and execute the analysis queries.
4. Explore the results and insights generated from the analysis.
5. Open the Power BI dashboard file in Power BI Desktop to interact with the visualizations.

## Dependencies
- MySQL or any other SQL database management system.
- SQL client tool (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, pgAdmin).
- Power BI Desktop for interacting with the dashboard visualizations.
