BANK LOAN ANALYSIS (POWER-BI)

Measures (DAX functions)

>DAX funcions is nothing but the tooles/functions like sum, avg, count, calander function etc... which is used to create
 measures.

At first we are going to create a extra date table using DAX function
1.Date Table = CALANDER(MIN(finincial_loan[issue_date]),MAX(finincial_loan[issue_date]))

Now we are going to extract month from the date in new column
2.Month = FORMAT('Date Table'[Date],"mmmm")

Now we are created 2 table and both are independent (date table and finincial loan), now we are going to create a
relationship b/w them by using data modelling.
Now drag the date from one table and merge it with issue_date in other.

3.Total Loan Application = COUNT(financial_loan[id])

4.MTD Loan Application = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total Loan Application],'Date table'[Date]))

5.PMTD Loan Applicarion = CALCULATE([Total Loan Application], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date table'[Date], -1,MONTH)))

Month On Month
6.MOM Loan application = ([MTD Loan Applications]-[PMTD Loan Applicarion])/[PMTD Loan Applicarion]

7.Total funded Amount = Sum(financial_loan[loan_amount])

8.MTD Funded Amount = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total funded Amount], 'Date table'[Date]))

9.PMTD Total Funded Amount = CALCULATE([Total funded Amount], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date table'[Date], -1,MONTH)))

10.MOM funded Amount = ([MTD Funded Amount]-[PMTD Total Funded Amount])/[PMTD Total Funded Amount]
    ( add $ symbol before exicution)

11.Total Amount Recieved = SUM(financial_loan[total_payment])
    ( add $ symbol before exicution)

12.MTD Total Amount Recieved = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total Amount Recieved], 'Date table'[Date]))

13.PMTD Total Amount Recieved = CALCULATE([Total Amount Recieved], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date table'[Date], -1,MONTH)))

14.MOM Total Amount Recieved = ([MTD Total Amount Recieved]-[PMTD Total Amount Recieved])/[PMTD Total Amount Recieved]

15.Avg Interest Rate = AVERAGE(financial_loan[int_rate])

16.MTD Avg Interest Rate = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Avg Interest Rate], 'Date table'[Date]))

17.PMTD Avg Interest Rate = CALCULATE([Avg Interest Rate], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date table'[Date], -1,MONTH)))

18.MOM Avg Interest rate = ([MTD Avg Interest Rate]-[PMTD Avg Interest Rate])/[PMTD Avg Interest Rate]

19.Avg DTI = AVERAGE(financial_loan[dti])

20.MTD Avg DTI = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Avg DTI], 'Date table'[Date]))

21.PMTD AVg Interest Rate = CALCULATE([Avg Interest Rate], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date table'[Date], -1,MONTH)))

22.PMTDAvg DTI = CALCULATE([Avg DTI], DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date table'[Date], -1,MONTH)))

23.MOM Avg DTI = ([MTD Avg DTI]-[PMTD Avg DTI])/[PMTD Avg DTI]

DASHBOAD 2 (OVERVIEW)

Since the y axis and x axis is not changing based on filter we are going to create field parameter for that
s1) Go to modeling near home tab
s2) Click new parameter option and click field parameter.
s3) After creating add it on Y axis of graph to change.

Creating month number in date table
32.Month number = MONTH('Date table'[Date])

INTERVIEW QUESTION
How will you sort months from jan to dec, since it is customized {time=(3:38:44)}

>Mean while if if click Total funded amont by term (donut chart) the values are not properly changing in other charts
 so 
 s1) Select that particular chart and go to format
 s2) click edit interaction
 s3) select each chart and click filter
